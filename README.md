# Highlighted-Histogram-Visualization
This repository showcases techniques for creating highlighted histograms to emphasize specific data ranges or categories within datasets. It demonstrates interactive and static visualizations, leveraging Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, with customizable color schemes, annotations, and threshold-based highlighting


## 1. 📌 Methodology

* Simulating and preparing datasets for analysis
* Plotting histograms using standard bins
* Customizing bin widths, axis spines, and grid styles for clarity
* Highlighting bins based on their values to emphasize key data points
* Emphasizing specific bins according to thresholds or areas of interest
* Adding annotations, footers, and credits to enhance interpretability and presentation

## 2. 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language for data analysis and visualization  
- **Matplotlib** – Creating customizable static histograms  
- **Seaborn** – Enhancing visual aesthetics and statistical plotting  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and preparation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations and array handling
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
